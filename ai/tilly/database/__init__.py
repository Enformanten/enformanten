"""
The database module is responsible for all communication
with the databases.

In this solution, we integrate with two databases: 
- One that holds tables of data related to Enformaten, and
- One that holds a table of users.

**Note**: In the current implementation, the `users` database
is an in-memory SQLite database. Further work could be done 
to integrate with a more robust database solution.

The specifications for each submodule are given in their
respective docstrings.
